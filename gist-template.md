# Regex-Tutorial

My name is Taylor Cannon this is my first regex! So bear with me please! 

## Summary

I will be describing a regex pattern for validating and extracting URLs from text. The regex pattern matches URLs that start with "http" or "https" and can contain various characters in the domain and path.

Code:
^(https?://)?([\w.-]+\.[a-z]{2,})?(:\d{1,5})?(/[\w./]*)?$

### Anchors
Anchors in regular expressions (regex) are special characters that represent positions within a string. They include ^, which denotes the start of a line or string, and $, which signifies the end of a line or string. Anchors are used to control where a regex pattern should begin or end its matching.
